# eBay-Rolex-Sales-Data

In this project, I employ Python, SQL, and Tableau to complete the following tasks: 

- Scrape and extract web data from an eBay search, filtering only sold items of a Rolex "Root Beer" GMT-Master II
- Export data to CSV file
- Clean and reformat data (converting data types, adjusting text strings, inserting necessary fields)
- Join and query data with another CSV file of additional data sourced from Kaggle
- Explore and analyze data with a few questions regarding sales
- Visualize the finalized data onto a dashboard that provides shorthand answers to sales data keypoints.

Follow along with the Jupyter notebook file (eBay Rolex Sales.ipynb) to see the process. See dashboard image (Rolex _Root Beer_ GMT-II Master Tableau.png), Tableau file (eBay Rolex.twbx), or follow this URL (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/x1van510/viz/eBayRolex/RolexRootBeerGMT-IIMaster) for visualization.
